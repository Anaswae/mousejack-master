Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 3
Document version: 1.1
Cert VU#981271
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/981271



Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that allows a device to be paired with
a Logitech Unifying dongle that presents itself as a mouse, but is actually
a keyboard. This permits keystroke injection without a keyboard being visible 
to the host operating system.



Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to pair a fake mouse with a target 
Logitech Unifying dongle, and use the fake mouse to inject keystrokes into the
target computer. The Logitech Unifying dongle presents the new device as a mouse, 
so the user would be unaware that a "keyboard" was paired with their dongle. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Logitech Unifying dongle (USB ID 046d:c52b)
  - firmware version 012.001.00019
  - firmware version 012.003.00025



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Logitech Unifying 
dongle, which requires physical proximity to the target computer.
